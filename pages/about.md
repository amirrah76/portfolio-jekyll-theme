# Amir's story...

My name is Amir Reza Rahimi. I live in London, UK.
My academic background includes a PhD in Applied Statistics, an MSc in Applied Statistics and a BSc in Statistics.
However, I worked in the legal sector for 19 years after completing my PhD in 2004.
I am now seeking to return to my original field of expertise, i.e. applied statistics and data analysis.
Hopefully, I will soon have some data analysis projects to refer to on this site!
Away from working life, I enjoying playing football (5-a-side), collecting stamps and reading.
But these days, most of my time (and attention) is taken up by my two kids...!
